Wide tilt up of the shop in Copenhagen\n              LEADIN: \n              An international group of scientists has engineered an enzyme which they say will be able to eat some of our most commonly polluting plastic.\n              Improvements aimed at making the enzyme work more effectively are now underway.\n              STORYLINE: \n              Looking out over the mountains of waste we produce it's hard to imagine an enzyme powerful enough to devour the plastics which continue to pollute our seas and oceans.\n              The plastic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most popular with the food and drinks industry. Bottles made from PET are used to package 70% of soft drinks, fruit juices and mineral waters sold in shops and supermarkets, according to the British Plastics Federation.\n              The scientists at Portsmouth University discovered the plastic-eating enzyme by accident.\n              Scientists in Japan in 2016 first discovered naturally occuring enzymes in bacteria which were capable of destroying plastic, but they weren't powerful enough to be developed for an industrial process.\n              The Japanese team used a natural enzyme called PETase to digest PET bottles and containers.\n              It was while they were investigating the structure of PETase that Professor John McGeehan and his team realised they'd managed to remodel the enzyme creating a far more powerful new version of the protein.\n              McGeehan says recycling is not keeping up with the production of plastics and it's time for scientists to use all the technology available to them to eradicate the problem.\n              He says: \"From the 1950s onwards the amount of plastic we are using it's just gone exponential. It's such an incredibly useful material for packaging. But also remember for the polyesters in your clothing and carpets and all those even medical devices, plastics have transformed our world. And that's not going to change.\"\n              Working with US colleagues, the Portsmouth scientists came here to the UK's Diamond Light Source synchrotron facility in Oxfordshire.\n              They subjected PETase to intense X-ray beams at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron facility in Harwell, Oxfordshire.\n              X-rays 10 billion times brighter than the sun are generated at the facility by accelerating electrons around a circular tunnel. The X-rays can be used to reveal the fine structure of materials and biomolecules, down to the level of individual atoms.\n              Using the PETase blueprint provided by the Diamond Light Sources, the scientists re-engineered an active region of the molecule. The result was a mutant protein with an enhanced ability to attack plastic.\n              \"What we're able to do is following on from the Japanese study is take the gene out of that bacteria and make the enzyme in the lab under control conditions. We can now generate grams of the enzyme. And in partnership with industry we should be able to generate kilograms of the enzyme. What we really need to do though is make it faster in order to make a real environmental solution. So we're quite a way off that yet, but this is a major step forward,\" says McGeehan.\n              The aim is to scale up the project so that it can be produced on an industrial scale. \n              McGeehan says: \"So discovery of the enzyme is amazing. Something that can eat plastic that normally takes 400 years to degrade, the bacteria are starting to eat this in a matter of days. What we've done is we've pulled out the enzyme from that bacteria and grown it up in the lab. And now we can actually digest PET within days much quicker than in the environment. And the idea here is that we can make the enzyme faster now by understanding how it works and then we have an industrial process.\"\n              What you're actually seeing here is the the plastic eating enzyme at work on a small piece of a plastic bottle. \n              This lab based work though is a long way from being able to produce enough of the enzyme for industrial purposes.\n              According to McGeehan the processes he and his team are looking at aren't too far away from what manufacturers are already doing in other industries.\n              He says: \"At the moment this is very much in a lab based scale, we're an academic lab and we're trying to figure out how this enzyme works. However if you look at other industries for example washing powder detergents, biofuels, all the technology exists to scale these things up once you've got a fast enough enzyme. The rest is actually quite straightforward. The hardest bit in the first place is breaking down plastic.\"\n              The enzyme study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)\n              The scientists say there is room to further improve the enzymes, making them much faster acting.\n              The next stage is to use the tools of protein engineering to achieve that.\n              \"We're a consortium of five labs in fact, with the UK, the USA, Brazil and we work together and basically the paper will be open access to everyone.

It's a global problem and it needs an international consortium to fix it,\" says McGeehan.\n              Scientist around the world are looking at different ways they can process materials to make them more biodegradable.

Bottles made from PET are used to package 70% of soft drinks, fruit juices and mineral waters sold in shops and supermarkets, according to the British Plastics Federation.\n              The scientists at Portsmouth University discovered the plastic-eating enzyme by accident.\n              Scientists in Japan in 2016 first discovered naturally occuring enzymes in bacteria which were capable of destroying plastic, but they weren't powerful enough to be developed for an industrial process.\n              The Japanese team used a natural enzyme called PETase to digest PET bottles and containers.\n              It was while they were investigating the structure of PETase that Professor John McGeehan and his team realised they'd managed to remodel the enzyme creating a far more powerful new version of the protein.\n              McGeehan says recycling is not keeping up with the production of plastics and it's time for scientists to use all the technology available to them to eradicate the problem.\n              He says: \"From the 1950s onwards the amount of plastic we are using it's just gone exponential. It's such an incredibly useful material for packaging. But also remember for the polyesters in your clothing and carpets and all those even medical devices, plastics have transformed our world. And that's not going to change.\"\n              Working with US colleagues, the Portsmouth scientists came here to the UK's Diamond Light Source synchrotron facility in Oxfordshire.\n              They subjected PETase to intense X-ray beams at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron facility in Harwell, Oxfordshire.\n              X-rays 10 billion times brighter than the sun are generated at the facility by accelerating electrons around a circular tunnel. The X-rays can be used to reveal the fine structure of materials and biomolecules, down to the level of individual atoms.\n              Using the PETase blueprint provided by the Diamond Light Sources, the scientists re-engineered an active region of the molecule. The result was a mutant protein with an enhanced ability to attack plastic.\n              \"What we're able to do is following on from the Japanese study is take the gene out of that bacteria and make the enzyme in the lab under control conditions. We can now generate grams of the enzyme. And in partnership with industry we should be able to generate kilograms of the enzyme. What we really need to do though is make it faster in order to make a real environmental solution. So we're quite a way off that yet, but this is a major step forward,\" says McGeehan.\n              The aim is to scale up the project so that it can be produced on an industrial scale. \n              McGeehan says: \"So discovery of the enzyme is amazing. Something that can eat plastic that normally takes 400 years to degrade, the bacteria are starting to eat this in a matter of days. What we've done is we've pulled out the enzyme from that bacteria and grown it up in the lab. And now we can actually digest PET within days much quicker than in the environment. And the idea here is that we can make the enzyme faster now by understanding how it works and then we have an industrial process.\"\n              What you're actually seeing here is the the plastic eating enzyme at work on a small piece of a plastic bottle. \n              This lab based work though is a long way from being able to produce enough of the enzyme for industrial purposes.\n              According to McGeehan the processes he and his team are looking at aren't too far away from what manufacturers are already doing in other industries.\n              He says: \"At the moment this is very much in a lab based scale, we're an academic lab and we're trying to figure out how this enzyme works. However if you look at other industries for example washing powder detergents, biofuels, all the technology exists to scale these things up once you've got a fast enough enzyme. The rest is actually quite straightforward. The hardest bit in the first place is breaking down plastic.\"\n              The enzyme study is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)\n              The scientists say there is room to further improve the enzymes, making them much faster acting.\n              The next stage is to use the tools of protein engineering to achieve that.\n              \"We're a consortium of five labs in fact, with the UK, the USA, Brazil and we work together and basically the paper will be open access to everyone.

It's a global problem and it needs an international consortium to fix it,\" says McGeehan.\n              Scientist around the world are looking at different ways they can process materials to make them more biodegradable.

Various people in protective suits.\nUS scientists have created a bacteria-killing enzyme that can detect and destroy anthrax.\nThe enzyme was isolated from a virus that attacks bacterial cells and they say it should work even if terrorists create antibiotic-resistant strains. \nOrdinary anthrax responds to antibiotics, but there is concern that terrorists might develop resistant strains. \nThe researchers suggested it would be difficult to create strains that resist the enzyme because it acts on a vital part of the bacterial wall, one that can't easily be modified.\nProfessor Vincent Fischetti of the Rockefeller University in New York and his colleagues reported that the enzyme, called PlyG lysin, kills anthrax bacteria in the laboratory.\nWhat's more, when they infected mice with a related kind of bacteria that can kill the animals within five hours, prompt treatment with PlyG saved 13 of 19 animals.\nThey also found that spores of this anthrax-related bacteria could be quickly detected using PlyG and a hand-held device.\nThe PlyG enzyme possibly could be made into a drug that would hunt down anthrax bacteria as they begin to infect a person or an animal, researchers said.\nResearchers said the next step will be further animal tests to see if the enzyme can halt an anthrax infection.\nThe key, researchers said, as with conventional antibiotics used against anthrax, is early treatment before the bacteria produce enough toxin to kill healthy cells and tissue.\n",

Just spray this solution on vegetables and plants....and watch them grow. Cultivation with enzymes is the latest craze in farming techniques. Some 50 varieties of vegetables, cereals and seaweeds are mixed with grapes, strawberries and other fermenting fruits. After three years and three months of fermentation, enough enzymes have been produced to induce dramatic plant growth.\nThe enzymes are diluted in 5,000 to 10,000 parts of water and then sprayed onto the leaves once a week or so. The plant enzymes stimulate the growth hormones and thus speed up the process of photo-synthesis.\nThe result is not only larger plants but also more nutritious, healthier and tastier vegetables and fruits.\nSince the solution is virtually odourless and not toxic like pesticides,\nenzyme-treated vegetables can be eaten fresh off the plant.\nVS farmer sprays crops with enzymes; \nCU giant vegetable; \nphotograph of farmer holding giant vegetable; \nphotograph of children with giant vegetable;\ntilt down to giant squash; \nbaby sleeping next to giant vegetables; \nchildren eat fruit;\nInterior factory; \nVS scientist stirring enzyme mixture; \nCU mixture; \nCU scientists measure enzymes;\nFarmer sprays tomatoes; \nchildren eat tomatoes from bush; \nVS farming scenes;\nCU fruit; farmer sprays crop; \nCU crop; \nfarmer picks apples; \nwoman next to giant pumpkin;\nMS vegetables: normal Japanese pumpkin on left, enzyme treated pumpkin on right; \nMS vegetables: normal onion on left, enzyme treated onion on right;\nGiant sunflowers; \nVS rose that bloomed for seven months.\nChildren play with giant pumpkins;\n",

Mid of the light powered electrochemical cell\nItalian researchers are developing an artificial leaf to copy the way plants produce energy from sunlight.\nIf they succeed, the device could deliver limitless green energy.\nThis is the ultimate green energy.  Photosynthesis is nature's way of turning sunlight into fuel for growth.\nSo if plants can produce hydrogen from the sun why not copy nature to produce green energy? \nResearchers from the Politecnico of Turin are testing an artificial leaf device to produce hydrogen from solar radiation and water.\nIn 2009 the Politecnico of Turin joined an ambitious EU project called Solhydromics.\nThe aim is to design an \"artificial leaf\" that mimics photosynthesis, the process through which plants use sunlight to split water into its two core components, oxygen and hydrogen.  If successful it could produce unlimited clean renewable energy.\n\"I have a motto about this project, and the motto is: 'if the leaf can do it, we can do it'. And we can even do it better,\" says Professor James Barber, founder of the Biosolar Lab where the experiments are carried out.\n\"I think it is actually a necessity to try to develop an artificial photosynthetic system, we might call it an 'artificial leaf', which is robust and cheap to manufacture and can convert the energy of light, that is sunlight, into stored energy of chemical bonds - that is, compounds like hydrogen or methanol or ethanol. So that we can generate fuel for our technologies where the energy has been derived from the sun.\"\nAll the elements are simple - but the science is just a bit more complicated.\nSimelys Hernandez is testing a light-powered electrochemical cell made from a cobalt-based material. She explains how it works:\n\"We are seeing what happens during photosynthesis in plants. Here we have a material that mimics the enzyme of photosynthesis when there is sunlight. It splits water into oxygen and protons H+ which are recombined in another electrode to produce hydrogen. In fact you can see on the surface of the electrode, which is our material, oxygen bubbles are developing.\"\nThe enzyme responsible for the photosynthesis is called Photosystem II. \nIn 2004 Professor Barber, from Imperial College London, revealed its detailed structure for the first time, winning numerous science prizes. \nAs Visiting Professor to the Politecnico, in 2009 he founded the Biosolar Lab in Alessandria, a 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Turin.\nHere the researchers are using Barber's research to understand better how Photosystem II functions in plants. \nBut nature's way is highly complex and difficult to mimic. \nBiosolar Lab's Cristina Pagliano explains the basic principle of the process.\n\"Our research at Biosolar Lab in Alessandria  is about an enzyme, the Photosystem II in its natural form. This enzyme is in the leaves of the plants. We extract it and try to purify it to obtain a crystalline form of the enzyme, so that we can analyze it by X-ray crystallography.\"\nResearchers work mainly on tobacco and pea plants, that grow quickly and have good foliage.\nThe green pigment in leaves comes from chlorophyll - the molecule that is critical to photosynthesis, channelling the sunlight into chemical energy.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the team is finding an efficient catalyst that doesn't need additional power input to split water into its component parts.  So far the catalyst remains elusive, but Professor Barber reckons that science will crack the problem within ten years.\nBarber was recently elected President of the International Society of Photosynthesis Research. Scientists all over the world are working to crack the code of artificial photosynthesis. \nNew Scientist magazine includes it among the fifty innovations that will change our lives.\n",
